# Trivia Quiz!

This challenge was given by The University of Minnesota Bootcamp 

This trivia quiz uses CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to prompt the user with a *timed* quiz which contains a set of questions the user can respond to. It will then, score the user depending on correct/incorrect answers. *P.S I deliberately made 2 of these questions really oppinionated to make the quiz less boring.*


### Scoring Summary
* The user will begin the quiz with a timer containing 55 seconds
* The user has unlimited responses
* _Incorrect answers result in a loss of 8 seconds in overall time/score_
* Final score is exclusive to the users remaining seconds on the timer

### This project has the following features: 
* A Start Quiz button 
* A Rules button
* A Submit Highscore button
* A Highscore Form
* A Countdown Timer
    
### Bugs

###### Due to the learning curb of JQuery and Boostrap, I didnt have much time to fine tune this application, subsequently, it has bugs. 
* Last question to game will prompt "Game Over" reguardless of correct or incorrect answer
* You cannot play the game more than once without refreshing
* The game 'technically' does not end at 0 seconds, it will still accept user input after
* I intended to not add the JSON statement that loads highscores correctly and more accurately, I dont have it fully grasped to implement at the time of sumission

### Extra add-ons

###### I enjoy adding quality of life (qol) functions to assignments, time permitting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring them to life on this assignment.

* A 'Change test theme' button would be really easy to implement and could contain different strings of questions/answers that would make the game surprisingly replayable given good, intriguing, questions
* The user could be rewarded with time for *correct* answers

If a dev were to implement only those 2 things, it would drastically change the replayabilty and overall depth of the entire app.
